# dotfiles
For my linux dotfiles, you know how it is, you gotta have em up somewhere.

Please ensure you have oh-my-zsh installed in your home directory before downloading and using any of my dotfiles.

Overall, anyone wanting to use my dotfiles should probably not unless they are familiar with PATH environment variables and want to go through my files changing some of the export and variable paths to fit their own home directory. Make no mistake, I am a (well, 'almost' as I've been getting better since I began maintaining this repo for my dotfiles) complete noob when it comes to using git and typical shell scripting, so this is a fairly simple dotfiles repo setup. I hope to learn to put commands in the install.sh file to automate the entire setup of this repo (because why would I install oh-my-zsh and everything when I could just clone a repo and run the install file?)

So yeah, clone at your own risk, thanks for reading, tell a cat hello for me (or something) and be well comrade.
