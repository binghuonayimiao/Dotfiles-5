# dotfiles
For my linux dotfiles, you know how it is, you gotta have em up somewhere.

Finished up with the install.sh script, now it downloads and does installs for:
Miniconda3, Oh-My-Zsh, OMZ plugins, Powerlevel10k theme, and Nerd Fonts.

Be sure to have wget before you try to run the install.sh script. Also shout out to jotyGill and their quicz-sh repo because copying and repurposing a lot of the code from their install.sh script helped me learn a lot about bash scripting and my install.sh wouldn't be working without it.
